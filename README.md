# <My Portfolio>

## Description

My motivation for this project is to display coding projects I have worked on while refining my skills in software development. This entails the portfolio itself, as well as the projects linked. I hope this will create a timeline of my journey as well as my top work to display to potential employers. This website is built with HTML and CSS, but will hopefully be adding JS in the future.
